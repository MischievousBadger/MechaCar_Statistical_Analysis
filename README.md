# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
-  Vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle and AWD variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 
-  The slope of the linear model is considered to be non-zero because the p-value (5.35e-11) is less than zero. 
-  This linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively approximately 72% of the time as the R-squared value is 71.49%.
