# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
-  Vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle and AWD variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 
-  The slope of the linear model is considered to be non-zero because the p-value (5.35e-11) is less than zero. 
-  This linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively approximately 72% of the time as the R-squared value is 71.49%.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch.  The current manufacturing data in total_summary shows that the overall variance between the 3 lots is under 100 psi; however, in the lot_summary, Lot3 shows a variance well over the acceptable amount, at 170.28.
